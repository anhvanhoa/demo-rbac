Vars:
    - Minutes:
          one: 'minute'
          other: 'minutes'
    - Houses:
          one: 'house'
          other: 'houses'

# Using variables in raw string
YouLate: 'You are %[1]d ${Minutes} late.'
# [x] is the argument position,
# variables always have priority other fmt-style arguments,
# that's why we see [1] for houses and [2] for the string argument.
HouseCount: '%[2]s has %[1]d ${Houses}.'
